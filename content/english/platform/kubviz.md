      * **Security Risks**: The lack of visibility increases the chances of security breaches, risking project release delays, customer loss, and diminished credibility for businesses.
      * **Inefficient Resource Utilization**: Difficulty in optimizing resource allocation results in wasted resources and increased costs.
      * **Slower Troubleshooting**: Dynamic nature of Kubernetes makes identifying root causes and troubleshooting challenging, resulting in prolonged downtime.
      * **Compliance and Regulatory Challenges**: Difficulty demonstrating compliance with industry regulations and standards leads to legal and financial consequences.
      * **Incompatible Tools**: Conventional monitoring tools are incompatible with distributed architectures, leading to error-prone analysis.
